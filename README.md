Sudoku

This project is a java implementation of a Sudoku game.

It is still very much a work in progress, but some planned features/functionality include:

-Board with typical sudoku features such as penciling

-Efficient implementation of algorithms for solving a given board (i.e. avoiding guess-and-check methods)

-GUI for user play with "hint" feature
